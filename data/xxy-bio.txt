I am a research scientist at Sea AI Lab. My research interest lies at the intersection of Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. 
In particular, my work focuses on understanding different aspects of visual information in images and videos, including texture, resolution, color, 
motion, depth, geometry, illumination, etc., and developing algorithms to reconstruct and enhance them.

I did my postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I was a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University. 
I got the B.Eng and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. I received my B.Ec degree in the National School 
of Development at Peking University. I was a visiting scholar at University of California, Merced and Harvard University. I am an Area Chair of CVPR 2023 
and have served on the Senior Program Committees of AAAI 2023 and IJCAI 2021.
